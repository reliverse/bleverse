# Code of Conduct

Bleverse is built around clarity, consent, and human-first design. Our community should feel safe, respectful, and welcoming to everyone who participates in good faith.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Bleverse community spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, chats, documentation, and events.

Participation in Bleverse spaces means agreeing to follow these guidelines.

## Our Standards

### We encourage

- Being kind, patient, and constructive
- Respecting different viewpoints and lived experiences
- Asking questions and giving feedback in good faith
- Focusing criticism on ideas and work — not on people
- Taking responsibility for your words and actions
- Caring about accessibility and inclusion
- Respecting boundaries and consent (social and technical)
- Repairing harm when it occurs

Bleverse values clarity over hostility, and dialogue over ego.

### We do not allow

- Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or bullying
- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language
- Sexualized language or unwanted sexual attention
- Threats, calls for violence, or incitement
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent
- Persistent unsolicited direct messages after being asked to stop
- Trolling, brigading, or intentional disruption
- Deliberate misrepresentation of others

Patterns of behavior matter. Repeated disruption, even if subtle, may still violate this Code.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All Bleverse project spaces (GitHub, documentation, chats, etc.)
- Any place where someone is officially representing Bleverse
- Public behavior that has a direct impact on the safety or integrity of the community

## Reporting

If something violates this Code of Conduct, please report it privately through **one** of the following channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** — open a private report via the repository's Security tab
- **Email** (preferred for now) — contact the project author at [blefnk@gmail.com](mailto:blefnk@gmail.com)

When reporting, helpful details include:

- What happened (links, screenshots, logs if relevant)
- When it happened
- Who was involved
- Any context that may clarify the situation

Reports will be handled respectfully and confidentially whenever possible.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may take appropriate action to protect the community, including:

- Requesting behavioral changes
- Removing or editing content
- Locking discussions
- Temporary suspension from community spaces
- Permanent bans in serious or repeated cases

Enforcement decisions are made to preserve community well-being — not to win arguments or silence disagreement.

We aim for proportional responses and prefer de-escalation whenever possible.

## Moderation Principles

- We act in good faith and expect good faith participation
- We prioritize safety over optics
- We prefer clarity over public conflict
- We aim for fairness, consistency, and transparency when appropriate
- We recognize that not every conflict is misconduct — but harm must still be addressed

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by established open-source community standards, including the Contributor Covenant, and adapted to reflect the values of the Bleverse community.
