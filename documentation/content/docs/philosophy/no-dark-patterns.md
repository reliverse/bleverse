Bleverse does not use dark patterns.

This is not a marketing claim.

It is a product constraint.

## What Are Dark Patterns?

Dark patterns are interface or behavioral design decisions that intentionally:

- Manipulate users into actions they did not intend.
- Obscure or hide important information.
- Make certain choices artificially difficult.
- Exploit cognitive biases for engagement or retention.
- Optimize for dependency rather than autonomy.

They are not accidents. They are strategic design decisions.

Bleverse rejects them.

## What This Means in Practice

### 1. No Manipulative UI

- No deceptive button hierarchy.
- No hidden opt-outs.
- No confusing consent flows.
- No artificially urgent messaging.

Primary actions will be visually honest.

### 2. No Forced Engagement Loops

- The feed is optional.
- Notifications are configurable.
- Infinite scrolling is not assumed.
- Attention is not treated as a resource to extract.

Engagement is not the primary success metric.

### 3. Clear Exits

- Accounts can be deleted.
- Data export is supported.
- Leaving should not require friction.

Retention through friction is a dark pattern.

### 4. Transparent Personalization

If content is ranked, filtered, or personalized:

- The logic should be explainable.
- The behavior should be adjustable.
- Personalization should be explicit, not hidden.

Opaque influence over user perception is not acceptable.

## Why This Matters

Social software shapes perception.

When platforms optimize for engagement above autonomy, they distort behavior and decision-making.

Bleverse explores a different default:

- Respect attention.
- Preserve agency.
- Prefer clarity over growth hacks.

## A Constraint, Not a Promise

"No dark patterns" is not a guarantee of perfection.

It is a design boundary.

If a feature requires manipulation to succeed, it should not exist.
