Bleverse may include advertising.

If it does, it must respect user autonomy, clarity, and consent.

Advertising is not inherently unethical. Manipulative advertising is.

## Core Principle

Advertising must never rely on deception, coercion, or behavioral exploitation.

Revenue must not compromise user agency.

## What Advertising on Bleverse Must Be

### 1. Clearly Labeled

- All advertisements must be explicitly marked.
- Ads must not visually imitate user-generated content.
- No ambiguous labeling such as "Recommended" or "Suggested" when the content is paid.

Users should always know when something is an ad.

### 2. Non-Manipulative

- No fake urgency.
- No artificial scarcity.
- No dark UX patterns.
- No forced interaction loops.

Advertising must not exploit cognitive bias.

### 3. Respectful of Attention

- No autoplay with sound.
- No blocking overlays.
- No deceptive close buttons.
- No scroll hijacking.

Attention is not a resource to extract.

### 4. Transparent Personalization

If advertising is personalized:

- Personalization must be explicit.
- Users must be able to disable it.
- The criteria for personalization should be explainable.

Hidden behavioral tracking contradicts Bleverse principles.

### 5. No Engagement Optimization

Advertising systems must not:

- Alter ranking algorithms to increase ad exposure.
- Incentivize addictive usage patterns.
- Compromise feed integrity.

User experience takes precedence over revenue metrics.

## Acceptable Models

Examples of models more aligned with Bleverse principles:

- Clearly separated sponsor sections.
- Contextual advertising (based on page content, not user profiling).
- Opt-in personalized ads.
- Subscription tiers that remove ads.
- Transparent sponsorships.

## What Bleverse Rejects

- Ads disguised as posts.
- Dark subscription funnels.
- Behavioral manipulation for click-through rates.
- Data extraction without clear consent.

If advertising requires deception to function, it should not exist on Bleverse.

## A Living Document

This policy may evolve, but its constraint remains:

Revenue must never override autonomy.
