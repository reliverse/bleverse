# Overview

Electrobun builds cross-platform desktop applications with TypeScript that are small and fast. Electrobun combines the power of native bindings with Bun's runtime for unprecedented performance.

## Features

- Native bindings written in C++, ObjC, and Zig
- Bun as backend runtime and bundler
- System's native webview as renderer, CEF Optional
- Custom bsdiff-based update mechanism
- Cross-platform: macOS, Windows, Linux

## Important

Electrobun is NOT Electron. Different architecture, different APIs. Do not use Electron patterns.
